DESCRIPTION
    While XRD has a rather different history, it turns out it can mostly be
    thought of as a serialisation format for a limited subset of RDF.

    This package ignores the order of <Link> elements, as RDF is a graph
    format with no concept of statements coming in an "order". The XRD spec
    says that grokking the order of <Link> elements is only a SHOULD. That
    said, if you're concerned about the order of <Link> elements, the
    callback routines allowed by this package may be of use.

    This package aims to be roughly compatible with RDF::RDFa::Parser's
    interface.

  Constructors
    "$p = XRD::Parser->new($content, $uri, \%options, $store)"
        This method creates a new XRD::Parser object and returns it.

        The $content variable may contain an XML string, or a
        XML::LibXML::Document. If a string, the document is parsed using
        XML::LibXML::Parser, which may throw an exception. XRD::Parser does
        not catch the exception.

        $uri the supposed URI of the content; it is used to resolve any
        relative URIs found in the XRD document. Also, if $content is empty,
        then XRD::Parser will attempt to retrieve $uri using LWP::Simple.

        Options [default in brackets]:

          * link_prop       - How to handle <Property> in <Link>? [0]
                              0=skip, 1=reify, 2=subproperty, 3=both.
          * tdb_service     - thing-described-by.org when possible. [0]

        $storage is an RDF::Trine::Storage object. If undef, then a new
        temporary store is created.

    "$p = XRD::Parser->hostmeta($uri)"
        This method creates a new XRD::Parser object and returns it.

        The parameter may be a URI (from which the hostname will be
        extracted) or just a bare host name (e.g. "example.com"). The
        resource "/.well-known/host-meta" will then be fetched from that
        host using an appropriate HTTP Accept header, and the parser object
        returned.

  Public Methods
    "$p->uri($uri)"
        Returns the base URI of the document being parsed. This will usually
        be the same as the base URI provided to the constructor.

        Optionally it may be passed a parameter - an absolute or relative
        URI - in which case it returns the same URI which it was passed as a
        parameter, but as an absolute URI, resolved relative to the
        document's base URI.

        This seems like two unrelated functions, but if you consider the
        consequence of passing a relative URI consisting of a zero-length
        string, it in fact makes sense.

    "$p->dom"
        Returns the parsed XML::LibXML::Document.

    $p->set_callbacks(\%callbacks)
        Set callback functions for the parser to call on certain events.
        These are only necessary if you want to do something especially
        unusual.

          $p->set_callbacks({
            'pretriple_resource' => sub { ... } ,
            'pretriple_literal'  => sub { ... } ,
            'ontriple'           => undef ,
            });

        Either of the two pretriple callbacks can be set to the string
        'print' instead of a coderef. This enables built-in callbacks for
        printing Turtle to STDOUT.

        For details of the callback functions, see the section CALLBACKS.
        "set_callbacks" must be used *before* "consume". "set_callbacks"
        itself returns a reference to the parser object itself.

        *NOTE:* the behaviour of this function was changed in version 0.05.

    "$p->consume"
        This method processes the input DOM and sends the resulting triples
        to the callback functions (if any).

        Returns the parser object itself.

    "$p->graph"
        This method will return an RDF::Trine::Model object with all
        statements of the full graph.

        It makes sense to call "consume" before calling "graph". Otherwise
        you'll just get an empty graph.

  Utility Functions
    "$uri = XRD::Parser::host_uri($uri)"
        Returns a URI representing the host. These crop up often in
        host-meta files.

    "$uri = XRD::Parser::template_uri($relationship_uri)"
        Returns a URI representing not a normal relationship, but the
        relationship between a host and a template URI literal.

CALLBACKS
    Several callback functions are provided. These may be set using the
    "set_callbacks" function, which taskes a hashref of keys pointing to
    coderefs. The keys are named for the event to fire the callback on.

  pretriple_resource
    This is called when a triple has been found, but before preparing the
    triple for adding to the model. It is only called for triples with a
    non-literal object value.

    The parameters passed to the callback function are:

    *   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

    *   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

    *   Subject URI or bnode (string)

    *   Predicate URI (string)

    *   Object URI or bnode (string)

    The callback should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not
    add it to the graph); return 0 otherwise.

  pretriple_literal
    This is the equivalent of pretriple_resource, but is only called for
    triples with a literal object value.

    The parameters passed to the callback function are:

    *   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

    *   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

    *   Subject URI or bnode (string)

    *   Predicate URI (string)

    *   Object literal (string)

    *   Datatype URI (string or undef)

    *   Language (string or undef)

    The callback should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not
    add it to the graph); return 0 otherwise.

  ontriple
    This is called once a triple is ready to be added to the graph. (After
    the pretriple callbacks.) The parameters passed to the callback function
    are:

    *   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

    *   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

    *   An RDF::Trine::Statement object.

    The callback should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not
    add it to the graph); return 0 otherwise. The callback may modify the
    RDF::Trine::Statement object.
